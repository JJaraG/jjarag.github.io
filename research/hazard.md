## **Earthquake rupture speed and high-frequency radiation**

<p align="justify"> Earthquake damage is largely controlled by high-frequency ground shaking generated during rupture propagation. These high frequencies are closely linked to variations in rupture speed, which in most earthquakes remains bounded by shear or Rayleigh wave velocities. In some cases, however, ruptures can locally transition to higher, so-called supershear speeds. Understanding where and why these transitions occur is therefore essential for interpreting strong ground motion and earthquake destructiveness. </p>

<p align="justify"> During my first postdoctoral work, I investigated this problem using theoretical arguments and numerical models that explicitly account for coseismic off-fault damage. This work showed that transitions toward supershear rupture are associated with a marked reduction in the width of the off-fault damage zone. We validated these predictions using natural observations, combining aftershock catalogs and image-correlation measurements of coseismic deformation. These results provided one of the first observational links between rupture speed, damage-zone structure, and high-frequency radiation, highlighting the role of fault-zone properties in controlling rupture dynamics (Figure&nbsp;1). </p> 

<p align="justify"> In my second postdoctoral period at GFZ, I extended this work by studying the interaction between rupture speed, damage zones, and high-frequency shaking during the 2023 Türkiye earthquake doublet. Using the exceptional strong-motion dataset provided by Turkish colleagues at AFAD, together with a high-resolution relocated aftershock catalog and fault-width estimates derived from InSAR observations, we analyzed spatial variations in rupture behavior. We observed a clear contrast between rupture segments, with lower aftershock density and narrower damage zones in the southern segment compared to the northeastern one. Rupture velocities in the south approached the Rayleigh wave speed and exhibited strong variability, whereas the northern segment ruptured more slowly. </p> 

<p align="justify"> By analyzing velocity spectra, we found that regions characterized by variable rupture speed systematically excited frequencies in the 0.5–1.5 Hz range, a feature absent in slower rupture segments. This frequency band is particularly efficient at damaging mid-rise buildings, suggesting a direct link between rupture dynamics and observed destruction patterns. These results indicate that the spatial extent of the damage zone, observable through both geodetic and seismological data, exerts a primary control on rupture-speed variability and the associated high-frequency radiation. A manuscript based on this work is currently in preparation. </p>

## **High-frequency radiation and its link with rupture speed**

<p align="justify"> During my current postdoc as a Marie-Curie fellow at GFZ in Potsdam, I am investigating the spatio-temporal distribution of high-frequency radiation produced by EQs. To achieve this, I am implementing a Bayesian kinematic source inversion model in the frequency domain to explore the relationship between the EQ rupture speed and high-frequency radiation. Firstly, I aim to determine whether the deeper part of the seismogenic zone produces higher frequency content, by studying the $M_w$ 7.7 Tocopilla EQ in northern Chile. Secondly, I will examine whether regions where EQs transition to supershear speed are natural sources of high-frequency radiation, as abrupt changes in rupture speed can generate such radiation. Both results will be combined with as much geophysical information as possible to discuss the link between high-frequency radiation and tectonic features. Therefore, the project will provide insights into how to track these high-frequency sources and understand their distribution over time and space.
