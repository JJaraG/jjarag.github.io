<p align="justify">I am a geophysicist with an observational seismogeodetic profile, combining seismological and geodetic observations, complemented by numerical modeling. My research has primarily focused on understanding the role of aseismic slip across the seismic cycle, with an emphasis on when, why, and how earthquakes (EQs) occur, and how they relate to local seismotectonic settings. This work has led me to analyze deformation processes across a broad energetic spectrum, from slow transients such as aseismic slip to fast rupture processes associated with EQs. These studies have been supported by extensive processing of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data and fieldwork, including the design, installation, and maintenance of geodetic networks, to better constrain the physical mechanisms governing fault deformation. I have also investigated how complex fault geometries influence rupture dynamics, particularly the transition to supershear EQs and its relationship with high-frequency seismic radiation. More recently, my research has expanded toward understanding how hydro-meteorological processes impact seismic hazard assessment in a restless Earth increasingly affected by climate change, by linking environmental forcing, fault mechanics, and time-dependent seismic hazard. </p>
