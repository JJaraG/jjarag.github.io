SEISCLIM - "Seismoctectonics and climate: challenges bridging scales"
======

<img style="float: center;" src="/images/research/hydroeq.jpg">

<p align="justify">
In summer 2025, I was awarded a grant from the <a href="https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/en" target="_blank">Volkswagen Foundation</a> through its <a href="https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/en/funding/funding-offer/pioneering-research-exploring-unknown-unknown" target="_blank">Pioneering Research – Exploring the Unknown Unknown</a> program at <a href="https://www.gfz.de/en/" target="_blank">GFZ Potsdam</a>. This project aims to understand how climate change influences seismic hazard by linking hydro-meteorological processes, fault mechanics, and time-dependent hazard assessment. Ph.D. and postdoctoral positions will open soon—stay tuned.
