Teaching and mentoring are central to my academic activity. I have taught at the <strong>undergraduate, master’s, and doctoral levels</strong>, in <strong>Spanish, English, and French</strong>, across a broad range of topics including <strong>mathematics, physics, seismology, active tectonics, geodynamics, and seismic hazard</strong>. This diversity reflects my interdisciplinary training and my commitment to connecting fundamental concepts with Earth processes.

I have served as a <strong>lecturer and teaching assistant</strong> in courses on <strong>probabilistic seismic hazard assessment, solid mechanics, seismology, maths, and geodynamics</strong> at the <strong>University of Potsdam, ENS–PSL, the University of Chile, and Universidad Andrés Bello</strong>. My teaching spans introductory courses to advanced master’s-level classes, with a strong focus on linking <strong>theory, observations, and real-world problems</strong>.

Alongside teaching, I am deeply involved in advising and mentoring early-career researchers. I have supervised or co-supervised <strong>1 undergraduate student, 2 master’s students, 5 Ph.D. candidates, and 2 postdoctoral researchers</strong>, within <strong>international collaborations</strong> across <strong>Germany, France, Chile, Türkiye, and Colombia</strong>. These projects address topics ranging from <strong>seismotectonics and aseismic slip</strong> to <strong>seismic hazard and interdisciplinary Earth science research</strong>.

Through teaching and mentoring, my objective is to help students and early-career scientists develop <strong>solid quantitative skills</strong>, <strong>scientific independence</strong>, and an <strong>integrated understanding of Earth systems</strong>, while fostering an <strong>open, collaborative, and supportive research environment</strong>.
