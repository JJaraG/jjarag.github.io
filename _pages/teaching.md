Throughout my career, I have been involved in teaching and advising at <strong>undergraduate, master’s, and doctoral levels</strong>, in <strong>Spanish, English, and French</strong>. My teaching covers <strong>mathematics, physics, seismology, active tectonics, geodynamics, and seismic hazard</strong>, reflecting my interdisciplinary background in solid Earth sciences.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I have taught as a <strong>lecturer and teaching assistant</strong> in <strong>probabilistic seismic hazard assessment, solid mechanics, seismology, and geodynamics</strong> at institutions including the <strong>University of Potsdam, ENS–PSL, the University of Chile, and Universidad Andrés Bello</strong>. These experiences range from introductory undergraduate courses to specialized master’s-level teaching, with a strong emphasis on linking <strong>theory, observations, and real-world applications</strong>.
</p>

In parallel, I am actively involved in advising and mentoring early-career researchers. To date, I have supervised or co-supervised <strong>1 undergraduate student, 2 master’s students, 5 Ph.D. candidates, and 2 postdoctoral researchers</strong>. My advising activities are embedded in <strong>international collaborations</strong> across <strong>Germany, France, Chile, Türkiye, and Colombia</strong>, and span topics from <strong>seismotectonics and aseismic slip</strong> to <strong>seismic hazard assessment and interdisciplinary Earth science research</strong>.
</p>

Through teaching and mentoring, my goal is to support students and early-career researchers in developing <strong>strong quantitative skills</strong>, <strong>scientific autonomy</strong>, and an <strong>integrative view of Earth processes</strong>, while promoting an <strong>open and collaborative research environment</strong>.
