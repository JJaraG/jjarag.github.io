<p align="justify"> Throughout my career, I have been involved in teaching and advising at undergraduate, master’s, and doctoral levels, in Spanish, English, and French. My teaching covers mathematics, physics, seismology, active tectonics, geodynamics, and seismic hazard, reflecting my interdisciplinary background in solid Earth sciences. </p> 

<p align="justify"> I have taught as a lecturer and teaching assistant in probabilistic seismic hazard assessment, solid mechanics, seismology, and geodynamics at institutions including the University of Potsdam, ENS–PSL, the University of Chile, and Universidad Andrés Bello. These experiences range from introductory undergraduate courses to specialized master’s-level teaching, with a strong emphasis on linking theory, observations, and real-world applications. </p> 

<p align="justify"> In parallel, I am actively involved in advising and mentoring early-career researchers. To date, I have supervised or co-supervised one undergraduate student, two master’s students, five Ph.D. candidates, and two postdoctoral researchers. My advising activities are embedded in international collaborations across Germany, France, Chile, Türkiye, and Colombia, and span topics from seismotectonics and aseismic slip to seismic hazard assessment and interdisciplinary Earth science research. </p> 

<p align="justify"> Through teaching and mentoring, my goal is to support students and early-career researchers in developing strong quantitative skills, scientific autonomy, and an integrative view of Earth processes, while fostering an open and collaborative research environment. </p>
