ERASMUS - MSCA: "Earthquake Energy Radiaton Across Spectrum: a multidisciplinary approach"
======

<img style="float: center;" src="/images/research/abstract_msca.jpg">

<p align="justify"> In the summer of 2022, I was awarded a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action Postdoctoral Fellowship (HORIZON-MSCA-2021-PF-01, 101066069, ERASMUS). This project aims to investigate the location of high-frequency (HF) sources, finding out their origins and relationship with tectonics, employing state of the art techniques. The fellowshipis hosted by the German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam, Germany, mentored by Prof. Dr.
Fabrice Cotton.</p>
