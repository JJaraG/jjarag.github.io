About me
======

<p align="justify">Welcome to my research webpage!</p>

<p align="justify"> I am a geophysicist using <b>seismogeodesy</b> to understand the <b>Earth's deformation</b> and <b>earthquakes</b>. Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/">GFZ</a>  <a href="http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/seismic-hazard-and-risk-dynamics/overview">Seismic Hazard and Risk Dynamics team</a>, in Potsdam, Germany. </p>

Research Interests
======

<p align="justify">My research focuses on understanding Earth's deformation at different spatio-temporal scales and its relationship to earthquakes. I am fascinated by how Space Geodesy (especially GNSS) and Seismology can be combined to understand better why and where earthquakes (will) occur. I tackle such exciting problems along the Chilean subduction zone, and the North Anatolian Fault.</p>

News
======

- <p align="justify">March 2023: Our session in the interplay between seismic and aseismic deformation on seismogenic faults has been accepted for the 2024 EGU General Assembly. See you in Vienna in April!</p>
