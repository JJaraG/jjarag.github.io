About me
======

<p align="justify">Welcome to my research webpage!</p>

<p align="justify"> I am a geophysicist using <b>seismogeodesy</b> to understand the <b>Earth's deformation</b> and <b>earthquakes</b>. Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/">GFZ</a>  <a href="http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/seismic-hazard-and-risk-dynamics/overview">Seismic Hazard and Risk Dynamics team</a>, in Potsdam, Germany. </p>

Research Interests
======

<p align="justify">My research focuses on understanding Earth's deformation at different spatio-temporal scales and its relationship to earthquakes. I am fascinated by how Space Geodesy (especially GNSS) and Seismology can be combined to understand better why and where earthquakes (will) occur. Additionally, I investigate the connections between hydro-meteorological processes and crustal deformation. I tackle such exciting problems along the Chilean subduction zone and the North Anatolian Fault.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>December 2025:</strong> Our new article "Atmospheric Water Vapor and Precipitation Coupling in Southwestern South America" has been published in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>! We analyzed 15–27 years of GNSS-derived precipitable water vapor (PWV) across Chile, revealing how PWV–precipitation coupling varies with latitude and precipitation regime. See <a href="/publications/">Publications section</a> for more info.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>December 2025:</strong> Our new article "Progressive eastward rupture of the Main Marmara fault toward Istanbul" has been published in <em>Science</em>! We analyzed the 2025 M<sub>W</sub> 6.2 Marmara earthquake and show a decade-long eastward migration of M>5 events along the Main Marmara Fault toward the locked segments near Istanbul. See <a href="/publications/">Publications section</a> for more info.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>November 2025:</strong> New preprint alert! Our study "<a href="https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.176337015.59445929/v1" target="_blank">Metamorphic dehydration reactions trigger slow slip events in subduction zones</a>" is now available on ESSOAr. Using thermal modeling across nine subduction zones and phase equilibrium analysis, we show that slow slip events cluster at ~100°C and ~450±100°C—coinciding with major dehydration reactions in subducting sediments and oceanic crust. </p>

<p align="justify"><strong>November 2025:</strong> New preprint alert! Mario Arroyo-Solórzano's latest study "<a href="https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.176296793.37188670/v1" target="_blank">Subduction Parameters Controlling the Occurrence of Shallow and Deep Slow-Slip Events (SSEs) Revealed by Machine Learning</a>" is now available on ESSOAr. Using decision-tree-based machine learning, we identify the key factors controlling SSEs globally: low dip angles, slow convergence, and fluid-rich conditions—with distinct depth-dependent patterns for shallow vs. deep events. Great job Mario!</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>November 2025:</strong> <strong>Postdoc position available!</strong> We are looking for a motivated early-career researcher (Ph.D. defended within the last 3 years) to join our team for the SEISCLIM project. The 2-year position focuses on integrating physics-based models with seismic hazard analysis. <strong>Application deadline: December 12th, 2025.</strong> More details available <a href="https://www.gfz.de/en/career/job-offers" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>October 2025:</strong> The SEISCLIM project has officially started! I have been awarded a grant from the <a href="https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/en" target="_blank">Volkswagen Foundation</a> through their <a href="https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/en/funding/funding-offer/pioneering-research-exploring-unknown-unknown" target="_blank">Pioneering Research</a> program at <a href="https://www.gfz.de/en/" target="_blank">GFZ Potsdam</a>. This project aims to understand the impact of climate change on seismic hazard. Ph.D. and postdoctoral positions will be opening soon—stay tuned!</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>August 2025:</strong> Our new article "Impact of geodetic information, subduction zone segmentation and slow-slip events in probabilistic seismic hazard: a case study for Costa Rica" has been published in <em>Geophysical Journal International</em>! This amazing work was carried out by Mario Arroyo-Solórzano during his Ph.D.—great job Mario! We propose a method to incorporate slow-slip events and geodetic data into probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, showing significant impacts on hazard estimates for Costa Rica's subduction zone.
