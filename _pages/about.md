About me
======

<p align="justify">Welcome to my research webpage!</p>

<p align="justify"> I am a geophysicist using <b>seismogeodesy</b> to understand the <b>Earth's deformation</b> and <b>earthquakes</b>. Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/">GFZ</a>  <a href="http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/seismic-hazard-and-risk-dynamics/overview">Seismic Hazard and Risk Dynamics team</a>, in Potsdam, Germany. </p>

Research Interests
======

<p align="justify">My research focuses on understanding Earth's deformation at different spatio-temporal scales and its relationship to earthquakes. I am fascinated by how Space Geodesy (especially GNSS) and Seismology can be combined to understand better why and where earthquakes (will) occur. Additionally, I investigate the connections between hydro-meteorological processes and crustal deformation. I tackle such exciting problems along the Chilean subduction zone and the North Anatolian Fault.</p>

<p align="justify"> <strong>January 2026. </strong><strong>Pre-print alert!</strong> A new study led by <strong>Angélica Buenrostro (a.k.a. Monse)</strong>, Ph.D. student at the <strong>Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile</strong>, in collaboration with <strong>GFZ Potsdam</strong>, is now available as a pre-print. This work explores how <strong>epistemic uncertainty in rupture parameters</strong> propagates into earthquake source characterization, with direct implications for seismic hazard assessment in subduction zones. By combining kinematic rupture models with a rigorous uncertainty framework, the study highlights where current assumptions matter most and where future improvements are needed. The study builds on close collaboration between Chilean and German teams and is part of a broader effort to better integrate physical modeling and uncertainty quantification in seismology.

<p align="justify"><strong>December 2025:</strong> Our new article "Atmospheric Water Vapor and Precipitation Coupling in Southwestern South America" has been published in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>! We analyzed 15–27 years of GNSS-derived precipitable water vapor (PWV) across Chile, revealing how PWV–precipitation coupling varies with latitude and precipitation regime.

We analyzed the 2025 M<sub>W</sub> 6.2 Marmara earthquake and show a decade-long eastward migration of M>5 events along the Main Marmara Fault toward the locked segments near Istanbul.

<p align="justify"><strong>December 2025:</strong> <strong>Call for abstracts!</strong> We are convening session <a href="https://www.egu26.eu/session/56660" target="_blank">TS1.8 – Seismic and aseismic fault deformation</a> at <a href="https://www.egu26.eu/" target="_blank">EGU General Assembly 2026</a> (Vienna, 3–8 May 2026). We welcome contributions exploring the diversity and interplay between seismic and aseismic slip phenomena, including the role of fluids, fault properties, and loading conditions in controlling fault slip behaviors. Observational, experimental, geological, and theoretical studies are all welcome! Convened with L. Dal Zilio, A. Bonnelye, P. Martínez-Garzón, and S. Michel. <strong>Abstract deadline: 14 January 2026.</strong></p>

<p align="justify"><strong>November 2025:</strong> New preprint alert! Our study "<a href="https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.176337015.59445929/v1" target="_blank">Metamorphic dehydration reactions trigger slow slip events in subduction zones</a>" is now available on ESSOAr. Using thermal modeling across nine subduction zones and phase equilibrium analysis, we show that slow slip events cluster at ~100°C and ~450±100°C—coinciding with major dehydration reactions in subducting sediments and oceanic crust. </p>

<p align="justify"><strong>November 2025:</strong> New preprint alert! Mario Arroyo-Solórzano's latest study "<a href="https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.176296793.37188670/v1" target="_blank">Subduction Parameters Controlling the Occurrence of Shallow and Deep Slow-Slip Events (SSEs) Revealed by Machine Learning</a>" is now available on ESSOAr. Using decision-tree-based machine learning, we identify the key factors controlling SSEs globally: low dip angles, slow convergence, and fluid-rich conditions—with distinct depth-dependent patterns for shallow vs. deep events. Great job Mario!</p>
