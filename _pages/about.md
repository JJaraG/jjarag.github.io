About me
======

<p align="justify">Welcome to my research webpage!</p>

<p align="justify"> I am a geophysicist using <b>seismogeodesy</b> to understand the <b>Earth's deformation</b> and <b>earthquakes</b>. Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/">GFZ</a>  <a href="http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/seismic-hazard-and-risk-dynamics/overview">Seismic Hazard and Risk Dynamics team</a>, in Potsdam, Germany. </p>

Research Interests
======

<p align="justify">My research focuses on understanding Earth's deformation at different spatio-temporal scales and its relationship to earthquakes. I am fascinated by how Space Geodesy (especially GNSS) and Seismology can be combined to understand better why and where earthquakes (will) occur. Additionally, I investigate the connections between hydro-meteorological processes and crustal deformation. I tackle such exciting problems along the Chilean subduction zone and the North Anatolian Fault.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>December 2025:</strong> Our new paper "Atmospheric Water Vapor and Precipitation Coupling in Southwestern South America" has been published in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>! We analyzed 15–27 years of GNSS-derived precipitable water vapor (PWV) across Chile, revealing how PWV–precipitation coupling varies with latitude and precipitation regime. See <a href="/publications/">Publications section</a> for more info.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>December 2025:</strong> Our new paper "Progressive eastward rupture of the Main Marmara fault toward Istanbul" has been published in <em>Science</em>! We analyzed the 2025 M<sub>W</sub> 6.2 Marmara earthquake and show a decade-long eastward migration of M>5 events along the Main Marmara Fault toward the locked segments near Istanbul. See <a href="/publications/">Publications section</a> for more info.</p>
